# KataKanbanBoard
Coding Kata - Kanban Board:

Your team needs a digital Kanban board urgently.

So create a board with columns for To Do, In Progress, Review and Done.

New tasks are set in the column To Do and are moved to the next right column, if there is not already reached the WIP limit.

Tasks has to be token by team members in the moment they move it to In Progress.

Visualize the board as you like
